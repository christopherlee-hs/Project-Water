Make sure the Excel file is closed before running the program.
If the pools do not all have the same number of teams, make sure that the pools with the most teams are to the left in the pools sheet (e.g. In the example, there are 57 teams, so the first column has 15 teams and the other three columns have 14 teams).
Make sure that each of the sheets has a title in the first row as in the example Excel file.
